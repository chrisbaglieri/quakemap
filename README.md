QuakeMap
========

QuakeMap is an uber-basic, asynchronous, server side event driven application built atop [Cramp](http://cramp.in) exposing data surfaced from the [quake gem](https://github.com/chrisbaglieri/quake/). There are some obvious holes that need filling but hey, it's just a silly exercise to kick Cramp's tires (which is freakin' awesome by the way) and eat my own dog food by using Quake.
